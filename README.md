The purpose of this project is to implement smart and efficient credential verification  using a raspberry pi and RFIDs. Data will be fetched from cloud in real time to the android  application which enables secure and accurate data. The government can keep track of the  uninsured and unregistered vehicles in the state or country in real time which will help them  devise better strategies to curb them. This system eliminates manual verification which has a high  chance of discrepancies and facilitates an easy way for the citizens to check their fine dues.
